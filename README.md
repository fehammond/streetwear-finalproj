I felt it most important to select a research topic I was thoroughly interested in, with little-to-no specific academic coverage. As result, I chose to explore the impact of purchasing bots in the streetwear community. I wanted to be the first to conduct research into this behaviour in such a niche area.

(Purchasing bot - automated technology that will add a product to your basket and checkout automatically, in a matter of seconds. More well-known in the tickets and events industry.)

I have had an interest in streetwear fashion and been part of the largest streetwear community, ‘The Basement’ Facebook group, since the age of 15. Ultimately, I understood this area in depth but since it’s relatively modern, there was absolutely no prior academic research into purchasing bot use in this field.

A mixture of questionnaires and interviews collated data from members of this community on their interests and purchasing habits to uncover the true thoughts and feelings on the impacts of this automated software.

The output of this final project was a portfolio, including a short dissertation and a self-coded, multi-media website. I utilised transmedia storytelling to display the process of the project, the key findings and self-reflection through photography and video.

Due to the size of the project, the only UX research involved was derived from the research findings. My aim was to convey my findings in a casual, enjoyable tone to suit the community but equally, anyone who came across the topic to learn more.
