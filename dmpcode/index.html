                    <h2 id="maincontent">Where did it begin?</h2>
    
                    <p>In an attempt to find my ‘style’ as a teenager, I came across <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/the-basement-interview/">The Basement</a>, a streetwear Facebook group for people to discuss and sell streetwear globally.</p> 

                    <p>There was something mesmerising about this group of stylish creatives... I wanted in.</p>
                        
                    <p>Now, a space for the cool kids, there are over 136,000 members. The Basement is thriving. As with anything, this is bound to create some difficulties. Some members have chosen to take advantage. Using automated software to check out on limited release drops, snapping up products and flipping for sometimes 10x the price.</p>

                    <h2>I decided to research...</h2>
                    
                    <p>I set out to explore the streetwear community, the way they purchase and the impact these bots have on purchase ability. I wanted to learn more about the space I'm part of, but in a way beneficial to a wider audience. Up until now, there's not been any academic research in this industry! So, I rallied up the troops in The Basement, sharing an online questionnaire and inviting resellers to interview. I think you'd be surprised with the <a href="#keyFindings">key findings</a> I identified!</p> 

                    <h2 id="keyFindings">Wanna know what I found?</h2>
                    <p>The importance of what I've found may be subjective, but first and foremost, the floor is now open to the consideration of automated purchasing software within streetwear and retail. I think that's a big one.</p>

                    <p>I’ve learned a lot about this group I identify with – we’ve moved to online purchasing and we’re even happy to purchase from a reseller despite such unruly prices. I also saw that bot-use probably won’t disappear, even though there is a general dislike for it inside this community.</p>
                    
                    <p>From here, I think we should dive deeper into the impact on our fellow consumers, the ethics of these automated tools and consider whether they're gonna stay. Much to the consumer’s dismay, it appears bots ain’t going nowhere unless the authorities have anything to do with it…</p>

                    <p>We buy for high quality and exclusivity and the lengths we’ll go to, to secure these items are extreme. Even paying 5x the price in the resale market solely due to pure desire! I guess you can’t show off a £300 hoodie to your mates if it’s poor quality and easily sourced, right?</p>

                    <p>Failure is inevitable. If you’re gonna use a bot, you gotta do the research. Most bot-failure is down to user error, anti-bot protection… and just too many bots! There’s no promising they’ll work, especially if they’re cheap and you’re new to it.

                    <p>Consumers HATE this army of robots. Swarm of flies. They think they’re completely unfair and ruin the fun of drops. Purchasing your holy grail item at retail price? Chance would be a fine thing… But, it fuels this economy, it makes that streetwear world go round. Resellers make their buck, consumer demand for brands goes up and we’re back to square one.</p>

                <h2>The Three Sins of Streetwear</h2>
                <p>A colour co-ordinated editorial shoot strips streetwear of its glory, positioning it in an uncomfortable light, mirroring three of the <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/7-deadly-sins-represented-with-web-design-colors/">7 Deadly Sins</a> and taking stylistic influence from Carissa Gallo's <a href="https://www.ignant.com/2014/08/05/pink-color-studies-by-carissa-gallo/">Colour Studies</a>. Projecting  through this work is my experience attending the <a href="https://www.180thestrand.com/lux">LUX exhibition at 180 The Strand</a>.

                <img src="img/pride2.2.jpg" alt="a male is sat holding a trainer shoe infront of him and the image displays tones of purple all over to represent pride">
                <p>Violet represents pride, an excessive love for oneself without considering others. Sound familiar? Copping streetwear is associated with exuding social status, as shown by this model displaying their Sean Wotherspoon Nike Air Max creps, <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/tag/sean-wotherspoon/">one of 1000 pairs produced</a> and now reselling for around £1000 GBP on <a href="https://stockx.com/en-gb/nike-air-max-1-97-sean-wotherspoon-na?country=GB&currencyCode=GBP&size=9&g_acctid=709-098-4271&g_adgroupid=&g_adid=&g_adtype=none&g_campaign=OD+-+PMax+-+Sneakers+-+International+%28UK%29&g_campaignid=17106184477&g_keyword=&g_keywordid=&g_network=x&gclid=Cj0KCQjwg_iTBhDrARIsAD3Ib5jaVczaESnZp_Qp3iNvOix3AW4SaUzNe9dHYDWwa6fBzM-z33szS3MaAmRyEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">StockX.</a></p>

                <img src="img/greed2.2.jpg" alt="a male's hands are gripping a plinth with lots of chunky silver rings, the image displays tones of blue and pink to represent lust">
                <p>Blue represents lust, an intense desire for unreasonable wealth amongst other things. Reselling exclusive items you secure with a bot, for 5x their worth practically embodies the want for money. The body language expressed in this image emanates a desperation for something… possibly cash.</p>

                <h3>Envy</h3>
                <img src="img/envy2.jpg" alt="a female is holding two trainer shoes under her chin and appears fed up, the image displays mostly green to represent envy">
                <p>Green represents envy, an intense desire for other’s possessions. Streetwear feeds off of a false sense of exclusivity driving demand to own hyped items. A symptom of this demand is the jealousy, the green-eyed monster, held by those who couldn’t get hold of their most wanted item while someone else did.</p>
